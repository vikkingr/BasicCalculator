# BasicCalculator
This is my calculator.

This is also my first tutorial I have completed involving a Windows Forms.
Mainly, I was just really curious about Windows Forms so I dedicated a few days to grind out an app.

Hilariously, this does not support PEMDAS.

However, I am very satisfied with the many things I learned during my development experience of this app.
